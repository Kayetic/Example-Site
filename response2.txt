A CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the part of a computer that performs most of the processing tasks. It acts as the "brain" of your computer and is responsible for executing instructions from software applications.

The speed at which a CPU can perform these tasks depends on several factors:

1. Clock Speed: A processor's clock speed refers to how many cycles it can complete in one second, measured in gigahertz (GHz). The higher the clock speed, the more instructions per second it can execute.

2. Number of Cores: Modern CPUs often have multiple cores - essentially separate processors within a single chip - which allows them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. More cores mean more processing power overall.

3. Cache Size: A CPU's cache stores recently used data so that it doesn't have to retrieve it from slower memory sources like RAM or hard drives when needed again later on.

4. Architecture: Different architectures are optimized for different types of workloads depending on their intended use cases — be they gaming PCs or servers running large databases and mission-critical systems

5.Thermal Design Power(TDP): TDP indicates how much heat needs dissipation by cooling mechanisms while operating continuously under full load(100% utilization).

By understanding these factors you'll know what kind machine configuration will give expected performance based upon user workload requirements i.e., whether he/she wants to game with high fps rates/develop apps/render videos etc..
